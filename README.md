# MarkerFlow Chrome Extension

Marker Flow is a simple Chrome application that allows you to create a new topic on a website, support it with a marker, or add a comment to an existing topic. The project includes a web site and an extension both written in React, as well as a GitHub repository containing an API developed usingÂ .NET Core. Backend operations are implemented using the ABP (Asp.Net Boilerplate) framework, supporting basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and enabling the system to be multitenant.
The project operates within an iframe between the web site and the extension, facilitating data exchange through the use of postMessage. Both sides trigger their own events and listen for incoming data from the other.
The web site communicates the positions of pins and cards to the extension, while the extension sends back the position of the created pin to the web site. The extension scans the DOM every second to find the positions of pins and uses multiple pieces of data to determine the pin's location. An example pin data can be found below.
